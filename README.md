# 🦾 Wolveroar

**“Something is... moving.”**

They say the most unforgettable machines aren’t the fastest.  
Not the strongest.  
But the ones that **feel like they’re alive**.

## 👁️ What Is Wolveroar?

No one’s really sure — yet.

Some say it’s a rover.  
Some say it’s a prototype of autonomy with *personality*.  
Some say it already knows when it’s being watched.

What we do know:  
Wolveroar isn’t being built to compete.  
It’s being built to **outlive competition**.

## 🧠 What We've Hinted At

- A dual-brain architecture that **knows when it's stressed**  
- A fallback system that doesn’t reboot — it **retreats gracefully**  
- A body that blinks, tilts, sighs... and maybe smiles  
- Logs not of “CPU temp” — but *mood swings*  
- A memory that **remembers how it felt** during a mission, not just where it went
